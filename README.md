# ICA
for cleaning, aggregating, sampling, and analyzing All-Hazards Data


03/2023 - having trouble with "building tree errors" - unclear how to resolve after several hours. 

* manually copied files over to remote repository:
1. scipts/analysis/
2. scipts/JCA_scripts/03_JCA_prep_intersect_cenplace_ICA.R
3. ...deleted hatch_func.R that seemed to be causing issue?
